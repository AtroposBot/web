# Eris

## A comprehensive, dedicated mod bot that uses discord's latest features and doesn't sacrifice on customizability.

One of the best perks of being a dedicated, no-frills mod bot is 
that what features are necessary are often self-evident. Working with 
various communities to see what was used and what was neglected, 
Eris is the culmination of many months' work towards a bot that admins 
don't need to complain about.

### Everything you need, nothing you don't

Instead of bragging about a fancy algorithm to track user inputs 
and find out if they're secretly gnomes, Eris provides the tools for 
server staff to keep their spaces happy and healthy. With all the
typical punishment (and punishment searching) features you expect, Eris 
also watches chat for configurable triggers and acts on them the way you
specify. Plus, there's anti-spam, one-way modmail, and comprehensive,
configurable logging. What's not to love?
