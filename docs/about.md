## The Bot

- Written in Java using Discord4J
- Named after Eris, the Greek goddess of discord
- Definitely not run by a volunteer team of gnomes

### Why?

Having worked with communities small and large,
I noticed a distinct lack of a 'great' mod bot - especially
one that was public enough for people who really needed it to
be able to use it. Having very few tech skills apart from working with
discord bots, I decided to write one that would have all the features I
needed. Always going through testing and improvement, Eris was the result.
