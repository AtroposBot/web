## What data Eris collects

Eris collects various types of data that you make available in a server that it moderates. 
As Eris is a moderation service, it needs to collect the following for the following reasons:

!!! info "User Account Information: **IDs, Usernames, Avatars, Nicknames**"
    
    For associating moderation action with a user and allowing moderators to reliably discover moderation histories.
    For detailed and informative logging of user activities and account changes

!!! info "Discord Guild Information: **Member Counts, Role Names and IDs, Member Changes**"

    For managing things such as muted roles, command permissions, anti-raid functions, and basic server information display.

!!! note "Messages"

    For auto-moderation and records purposes. Anti-scam, content blacklisting, and logging deleted messages beyond the 
    lifespan that a cache can provide all require that Eris stores and analyzes the content of messages.
    
    Messages are stored *at most* for 30 days, and then are permanently deleted. 

!!! danger "Moderation Features (Bans, Kicks, Warns, Mutes, and Notes)"

    For moderation and records purposes, these are stored permanently and include some User Account 
    Information of the moderator and user being moderated, as well as the date, reason, and supplementary
    bot usage information such as punishment duration and whether a punishment was automatically stored.

## Data Sharing

Data collected by Eris is not shared with any third party. The only way to access stored 
sensitive content such as recent message content is through the logging function; there is no
way to search through a user's stored message history as recorded by Eris, and it cannot be
accessed by anyone within or outside the guild except by Eris at the time of logging. Any data 
voluntarily recorded by moderators of a guild, such as punishments, can be accessed only by those who
have the appropriate permissions within that guild. Data collected with this bot may be stored 
off-platform for the purposes of maintaining the operation of the service, such as in 
an encrypted database.

If you have concerns about Eris, you can contact the developer via email at hey@laarryy.dev

## Data Removal

For immediate removal of all of a guild's or user's data from Eris' records, use
the provided slash commands (`/wipe`). Should the bot be down or the command not function, you 
may also use the contact information provided above.
